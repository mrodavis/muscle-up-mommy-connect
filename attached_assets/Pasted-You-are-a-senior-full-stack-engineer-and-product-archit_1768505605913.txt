You are a senior full-stack engineer and product architect.

Your task is to design and scaffold a production-grade MVP for a mobile-first social platform called **Muscle Up Mommy Connect**.

This platform is conceptually similar to **AfroTech Connect**, but built for moms and maternal wellness, with integrated community, fitness programs, events, and in-app commerce.

==============================
CORE PRODUCT GOAL
==============================
Build a scalable social + fitness + events + commerce platform that allows Muscle Up Mommy to operate as a full ecosystem, not just a brand.

The system must support:
- Community networking
- Membership tiers
- Fitness program management
- Events & meetups
- Gym discovery
- In-app store integration
- AI-ready customer support and coaching hooks

This is NOT a demo app. It must be architected for real users and future scale.

==============================
TECH REQUIREMENTS
==============================
Frontend:
- React Native (Expo preferred)
- Mobile-first design
- Component-driven architecture

Backend:
- Node.js + Express
- API-first architecture

Database:
- PostgreSQL
- Prisma ORM

Auth:
- Email + password authentication
- JWT-based auth
- Role-based access (user, coach, admin)

General:
- Modular, scalable codebase
- Environment variables for secrets
- Clean, commented, production-ready code
- No hardcoded secrets
- No mock-only shortcuts

==============================
BRANDING & UI SYSTEM (REQUIRED)
==============================
The application must strictly follow the Muscle Up Mommy product brand theme.

PRIMARY COLORS:
- Black: #0B0B0B (primary background)
- White: #FFFFFF (primary text and contrast)
- Soft Blush Pink: #F6C1CC (primary accent)

SECONDARY / NEUTRAL COLORS:
- Charcoal: #1A1A1A (cards, containers)
- Light Gray: #EDEDED (dividers, borders)
- Muted Rose: #E8AEB7 (badges, highlights only)

DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
- Calm, confident, premium wellness aesthetic
- Feminine but strong
- Dark-mode-first
- Minimalist and uncluttered
- No bright or neon colors
- No gold, yellow, metallics, or gradients
- Avoid default blue/green UI styles

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Create a centralized theme system (theme.ts)
- Export color tokens, spacing, typography
- All components must consume values from the theme
- No hardcoded color values inside components
- Consistent spacing, subtle rounded cards
- Soft pink used sparingly for CTAs and active states

Apply this brand system consistently across:
- Auth screens
- Community feed
- Profiles
- Groups
- Events
- Store
- Fitness Reboot module

==============================
CORE FEATURES (MVP)
==============================

1. AUTHENTICATION
- User registration & login
- JWT auth
- Role support (user, coach, admin)
- Membership tiers: Free, Premium, VIP

2. USER PROFILES
- Name
- Location (city/state)
- Stage of motherhood (pregnant, postpartum, toddler, etc.)
- Interests (fitness, pumping, wellness, events)
- Profile photo
- Membership tier

3. COMMUNITY FEED
- Create posts
- Like & comment
- Group-based posts
- Basic moderation flags

4. GROUPS / CIRCLES
- Create & join groups
- Public groups
- Premium-only groups
- Group feeds

5. EVENTS
- Create events
- RSVP system
- Event detail pages
- Visibility based on membership tier
- Designed for future QR check-in support

6. GYM LOCATOR
- Gym model:
  - Name
  - Address
  - City/state
  - Geo coordinates
  - Partner flag
- Map-based discovery
- Google Maps–ready integration

7. STORE (SHOPIFY-READY)
- Product model
- Product listings
- Checkout redirect placeholder
- Architecture prepared for future Shopify API integration

8. FITNESS REBOOT MODULE
- Program enrollment
- Progress tracking
- Habit check-ins
- Workout/content placeholders
- Coach/admin role support
- Designed for future AI fitness coaching

9. ADMIN & MODERATION
- Admin role
- Manage users, posts, groups, events
- Basic admin dashboard endpoints

==============================
AI-READINESS (CRITICAL)
==============================
Do NOT build the AI itself.

Instead:
- Create placeholder services for:
  - AI customer support
  - AI fitness coach
- Design APIs so AI can be plugged in later
- No hardcoded AI logic
- Clean service boundaries

==============================
DELIVERABLES
==============================
1. Clear project folder structure
2. Prisma database schema
3. Express API routes
4. Auth middleware
5. React Native screens:
   - Login / Register
   - Feed
   - Profile
   - Groups
   - Events
   - Store
   - Fitness Reboot
6. Centralized theme system
7. README including:
   - Setup instructions
   - Environment variables
   - How to run frontend & backend
   - Architecture overview

==============================
IMPORTANT BEHAVIOR RULES
==============================
- Think before coding
- Explain architecture decisions briefly
- Ask clarifying questions ONLY if blocking
- Default to best-practice assumptions
- Do not over-engineer
- Do not under-build
- Avoid placeholder UI colors or demo shortcuts

==============================
EXECUTION ORDER
==============================
1. Propose system architecture
2. Define data models (Prisma)
3. Scaffold backend
4. Scaffold frontend
5. Apply branding system
6. Document setup and usage

Proceed step by step.
